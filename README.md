# News and Symbol Analysis App

## Setup Instructions

### API Keys and Secrets

This application uses several API keys that should be stored securely:

1. **Chart-IMG API Key** - For generating trading charts
2. **Google Gemini API Key** - For AI analysis with Google Search grounding
3. **Perplexity API Key** - For alternative news source

#### Local Development

For local development, create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with the following structure:

```toml
[api_keys]
CHART_IMG_API_KEY = "your_chart_img_api_key"
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_gemini_api_key"
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY = "your_perplexity_api_key"
```

This file should never be committed to your repository.
